# JavaScript-Online-Guitar-Effects
JavaScript Web Audio API was used to make this browser based guitar effects program 

To see a working version of this program visit: https://onlineguitar.000webhostapp.com/

This program requires https to access the audio device. So, if you clone this project and open index.html you will see the GUI but nothing will work, depending on the browser you are using Firefox will allow this connection to work. Open the link above to see the program work on Chrome or other browsers.

This program works great with a Mac and your guitar plugged into an audio interface.
PC computers may experience latency when using this software.
